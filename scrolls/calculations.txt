<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>
    The goal of this project is to build qubits using a single graphene junction as easily as possible(in order to satisfy very short time requirements) by copying existing graphene junction fab process and existing transmon qubit geoemtry.  Since the overall geometry is fixed, the only free parameters are the junction geometry, and calculations reflect that.

    <p>
    We need to use Ambregokar Barratoff to get between $I_C$ and $R_N$.  We also need to use the data in the published graphene fab papers to get estimates that get us between gap width and length and estimated junction parameters.  At least for now, those are the only calculations.  Converting critical current to Josephson inductance is also useful.

    $$I_C = \frac{\pi\Delta}{2eR_n}$$
$$R_n = \frac{\pi\Delta}{2eI_c}$$
$$L_J = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi I_C}$$
$$I_C = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi L_J}$$
$$\Phi_0 \equiv \frac{h}{2e} = 2.07\times10^{-15} \textrm{Wb}$$
$$1 \textrm{Wb} = 1 \textrm{henry[H]}\times 1\textrm{ampere[A]}$$
$$\frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi} = 1.7\times10^{-16} \textrm{Wb} = 170 \textrm{nH}\times\textrm{nA}$$
